# github-search

An application I made using jQuery as an assignment for a job interview. The application searches github repositories and shows the open issues created on the current day for the repository selected.

On clicking an issue's title, following information is displayed:

- Issue title
- Issue description
- Any associated tags
- Image of the user who created the issue

On clicking the image of the user, the following details are shown:

- User’s picture
- User’s name
- User’s Github Url

There is a counter at the top right of the application which holds a count of the number of times an issue has been clicked/visited. This count persists even after multiple refreshes and after accessing the application after restarting the browser.
